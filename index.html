        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>My name is Suhail Kader.I am twenty three years old and a student currently studying towards my Bsc in computer Science at walter sisulu university.</p>
        <p>I was born on the 29 April 1996. I grew up in Mthatha and comlpeted High school at UHS. I have one younger sibling.
        Some of my hobbies include reading manga,football and collecting and building model cars. I am a tech entustiast and love anything involving compters.</p>
       
        <h2>My university</h2>
        <p> First, my experience in University has given me a chance to sharpen my skills in my field of choice. 
		    There have been, and there will continue to be, many opportunities to learn more ways of improving my craft as a result of my time in school,
			which I am truly thankful for. For example, it has taught me many new concepts of computers that I was unaware even existed, and would still be unaware of had it not been a part of my experience. 
			Because of this, I realized I still had a lot to learn despite what I thought; but this allows me to improve my skills more as I continue to attend school and also gives me more confidence in my area.
			And as a result, I know one day this valuable experience will help me in my search for another one-a rewarding career.</p>
